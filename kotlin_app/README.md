### how to work with the formatter

Install Ktlint

    brew install shyiko/ktlint/ktlint
    
    
You may run it manually to check

    ktlint --color
    
Or apply its settings to IDEA

    ktlint --apply-to-idea
    
Now you can use 'Reformat code' command (option + command + L) on the current file or an entire folder
